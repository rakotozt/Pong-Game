# Pong-Game
Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed arcade video game. It  was one of the earliest digital games ever created. It was manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972. In this project, we attempted to recreate this iconic game. However during the COVID-19 time , access to hardware components was limited so the goal was to reproduce in a way that it can be made from accessible components. We used a PIC32, an Adafruit LCD, Potentiometer and a breadboard to achieve this. We also extended the project by adding a soundtrack to the game.
